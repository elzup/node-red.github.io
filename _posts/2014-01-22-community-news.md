A couple community things we wanted to highlight.

### Postscape IoT Awards

Voting for Postscapes 3rd annual [Internet of Things awards](http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-award/) is currently open and we're very grateful to find Node-RED nominated in both the [Open Source](http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-award/open-source/) and [Technical Enabler](http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-award/iot-technical-enabler/) categories.

You can vote for Node-RED [here](http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-award/project/node-red/).

### Makerland Conference

Tickets are now available for the first [Makerland conference](http://www.makerland.org/) in March. A 3 day event in Warsaw, Poland, that promises to offer a mix of talks and workshops on all things IoT.

One of the workshops is being run by friend of Node-RED, [Charalampos Doukas](http://www.makerland.org/speakers/#charalampos) and is described as:

> **[Magic Lights](http://www.makerland.org/workshops/#magic)**

>The workshop project involves using a RaspberryPi and Bluetooth 4.0 for automatically turning on a Philips Hue wireless lamp based on user proximity (using a smartphone or a device like the Fitbit). The workshop will teach participants how to use Node-RED for interacting with Objects/Smart Things. We will learn the basic elements of Node-RED, how to interface with hardware like the Arduino, how to write custom code and how to consume external services using APIs.

[Early bird tickets](http://www.makerland.org/tickets/) are available for a couple more weeks.

If you have anything you want to share about Node-RED, please do get in touch - either on [twitter](http://twitter.com/nodered) or the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/node-red).
