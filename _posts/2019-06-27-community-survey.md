description: We asked, you answered, we compiled the results

Earlier this year we invited the community to complete a short survey about Node-RED.

We wanted to get a better picture of who our uses are, what they do with Node-RED
and to make sure we keep the project pointed in the right direction.

The survey was open for 6 weeks and we really had no expectations for what sort
of response we would get. Thankfully our community delivered with 871 replies to
the survey.

It has taken some time to compile the results, in no small part the need to read
and categories over 2000 written in comments.

This was a really useful exercise in getting to know our community better. The
feedback will be invaluable to how we prioritise ours plans beyond version 1.0.

Thank you to everyone who participated.
