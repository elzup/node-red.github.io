    <meta property="og:description" content="The modern company requires solutions that are able to deliver quickly and cleanly while also emphasising on clarity from the code which can be reusable among other developers within the company. This is where Node-Red comes in; where it can pull the strings from the hardware which we depend on, such as Raspberry Pis, and essentially work to connect different services together, including with the database of the company’s choice. Understanding how this can be made possible is crucial for any company that operates&#x2F;are looking to operate with Node-RED so that they are able to make the most optimal use with the language.In this talk, I will discuss how modern company structures are changing, and how it will look like when Node-RED is added into the mix to be a part of core business services. I will cover design patterns with the architecture that will be able to achieve this, while also talking in depth in regards to deployment procedures such as those involving CI&#x2F;CD pipelines. Alongside this, I will also talk about how monitoring tools from cloud-based platforms such as AWS can be used to monitor the progress of deploying the made service on the cloud and how the business can best make use of the analytics to adapt the service to the environment. This will encourage developers and business owners to incorporate Node-RED into their own businesses.To support this, I will also go over a case study of one of the projects that I have handled as well. I will talk about issues that I have encountered in different parts of the development of the service. This will also help the audience to see firsthand how the architecture talked about would be applied in a real-life context, and help them think how they can adopt the methodology to their own needs as well. I will also discuss different options for deployment, and show a live demo of how it would look like when it is done.">
