                <p>Agilit-e, pronounced "agility", is a Low-code, agile, integration service portal, that allows
                    configuration of modules provided by Agilit-e to create custom Microservices and integrations.</p>

                    <li>Converting data from one format to another (e.g. EXCEL to JSON)</li>
                    <li>Configuring integration points between on premise and/or cloud applications</li>
                    <li>Generating PDFs programmatically</li>

                <p>Node-RED is used as an extension to Agilit-eâ€™s ecosystem. Both can exist independently
                    from each other, but together provide a simple, seamless and powerful means of integration.</p>
                <p>Connecting these two solutions together is as easy as importing the Agilit-e Nodes into
                    your Node-RED environment. This means that both Agilit-e and Node-RED can exist in the
                    cloud, on premises, or a combination of the two.</p>

                <p>Over the last few years Node-RED has proven itself to be a product that allows the implementation
                    of high performance integration flows, that are stable enough to be run in production environments.</p>
                <p>The simplicity of creating custom nodes within Node-RED heavily influenced their decision to allow Node-RED
                    as a means of integration into Agilit-e.</p>
                <p>Finally, the frequent and continuous delivery of features and improvements has Agilit-e paying very
                    close attention to every release announcement from the Node-RED team.</p>
