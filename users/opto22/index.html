                    <a href="http://www.opto22.com">Opto 22</a> designs and manufactures industrial control products and 
                    Internet of Things platforms that bridge the gap between information technology (IT) 
                    and operations technology (OT) to bring IO to the IIoT. Based on a core design philosophy of 
                    leveraging open standards, their products are deployed worldwide in industrial automation, 
                    process control, building automation, industrial refrigeration, remote monitoring, and 
                    data acquisition applications.

                    <a href="https://www.opto22.com/products/groov-epic-system"><i>groov</i> EPIC</a> is a quad-core, Linux-based,
                    real-time controller with modular industrial I/O, a built-in touch screen, dual independent Ethernet ports, 6 GB 
                    of storage, and a wide variety of programming options.

                <p>
                    Node-RED data flow programming complements and interacts with onboard hardware, industrial control programming 
                    languages, and C++/Java/Python applications, as well as data from MQTT/Sparkplug B clients, Inductive Automation's 
                    Ignition platform, and the <i>groov</i> View operator interface, all on the same device.

                    <a href="https://www.opto22.com/products/groov-rio"><i>groov</i> RIO</a> is an ARM-based remote 
                    I/O module with dual switched Ethernet ports, 2 GB of storage, USB expansion, and thousands of 
                    software-configurable I/O options. With power-over-Ethernet installation and hazardous locations 
                    approvals, <i>groov</i> RIO uses Node-RED to capture traditional I/O data anywhere it resides and move 
                    it anywhere you need it: to control systems, databases, or applications on-premises or in the cloud.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <i>groov</i> devices also protect your Node-RED installation with device firewalls, VPN access, 
                    TLS encryption, and user authentication. Node-RED is fully integrated with the <i>groov</i> Manage web 
                    interface, including full project backup and restore functions and a viewable diagnostics log.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, Opto 22 has created Node-RED nodes for

                <p>
                    Node-RED’s promise of “wiring together hardware devices, APIs, and online services” gets the data where you need it,
                    simply and easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Node-RED and <i>groov</i> hardware together give you the tools you need to make your IIoT project a reality.
